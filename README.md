# supervised-detection-exoplanets-hci

Code for paper: "Supervised detection of exoplanets in high-contrast imaging sequences", Gomez Gonzalez et al 2018. Developed in Python 2
but compatible with Python 3. This package enables the generation of labeled data (MLAR smaples) for training machine learning classifiers. 
It also contains a function for building and training the neural network model that succesfully exploits the 3 dimensions of the training 
samples (hybrid convolutional and recurrent network). I used Keras/Tensorflow for the network implementation.
